This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic aspect of VBScript's `ByRef` parameter passing when used with numbers.  The example highlights how modifying a `ByRef` numerical parameter inside a function directly affects the original variable, which may differ from the behavior in other languages and can lead to unexpected results if not carefully considered. The solution shows how to avoid this by using `ByVal` or creating a copy.
